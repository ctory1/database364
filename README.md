This database stores all Movies, Directors, Actors, Genres, and Reviews from the top 1000 movies of all time!

It is ran on a front-end interface using HTML/CSS.
PHP is used to process back-end work and querying out the data using SQL, (commmunicating with the MySQL database schema)

This is crucial to note: this database is ran locally, specifically on the localhost port server.
Eventually there will be more implementation to run on websites so all users can access it!
